    "short_description": "Retinoic acid (aka tretinoin) is the gold standard of anti-ageing and works in a number of ways. Firstly, it blocks the production of collagen-degrading enzymes, meaning collagen does not get broken down as quickly in the skin. After prolonged use (6M+), it has also been shown to stimulate the production of type I and type III collagen, reducing wrinkles and improving skin firmness. It has been shown to protect against UV-induced damage, as well as reducing the appearance of hyperpigmentation in the skin. Skin treated with retinoids is smoother, more even-toned, firmer and younger looking.\n\nVitamin A is a family of ingredients also known as retinol, retinaldehyde, encapsulated retinaldehyde, Retinoic acid (aka tretinoin), hydroxypinacolone retinoate, retinyl palmitate, retinyl propionate or retinyl retinoate (8x more powerful than retinol). Vitamin A is one of the most well-researched actives used in skincare today.
